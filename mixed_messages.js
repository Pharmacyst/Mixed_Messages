This script is designed to create random mad-lib type messages. The structure of the message is:

"The [adjective] [noun] [past-tense verb] [adverb] in the [noun]."

Each word comes from a separate array.  A random number generator chooses an index for each array, and a function using those indicies as arguments concatenates the selected
words into the sentence, then returns the sentence. */
